TODO

More specific TODO lists may be in other documents.

### 2022-01-13 TODO GitHub Pages

- [x] Googling "convert markdown github to web page" leads to [How to convert GitHub Markdown files to a simple website](https://dev.to/bolajiayodeji/how-to-convert-github-markdown-files-to-a-simple-website-4e14)
- [x] GitHub pages did not work yet. Waiting a while to see if it starts up automatically.
- [x] Renaming root README to have lower case extension .md helped.
- [x] Links to folders do not seem to work. Maybe also change the file extension to lower case for those readme's.
- [x] Automatic links do not seem to work. Using the syntax `[Description](https:\\my-url)` may help.
- [x] Link to Archive seems to not work: [Piano Playing Docs](https://jjvanzon.github.io/Piano-Playing-Docs/). Adding a README.md to that folder helped.
- [x] Perhaps adding name and date to articles, now that it is in web site form it may be useful. Or perhaps only the date or only the month or year.
- [x] Horizontal lines:
    - [x] Grid rows with only dashes in it seemed to not render.
    - [x] Horizontal line `-----` seems interpreted as headings in bullet pointed lists.
    - [x] `<br/><br/>` seems an alternative for horizontal space in lists.
    - [x] `-----` formatted as inline code seems to help inside table rows.
- [x] Table layout seems applied inappropriately when using `|` in a bullet point's text. Replaced with commas `,`.
- [x] MarkDown (tables) nested in HTML tables showed the MarkDown literally inside the rendered page.
    - [x] Trying a trick `<td markdown="1">` from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15917463/embedding-markdown-in-jekyll-html) helped.
- [ ] Links that start with slash, seem to use the wrong base URL and makes links break
    - [ ] E.g. link to "/methods/practice-schema.md" does not seem to work.
- [ ] No home link, like clicking on the logo.
- [ ] External links to open in new tab using `<a>` tags.
