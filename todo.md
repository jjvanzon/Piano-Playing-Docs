    - [ ] Might become more relevant once I might improvise more.

### 2022-02-03 Brainstorm Styles & Attitudes

- [ ] Perhaps write down what kind of __styles__ and __attitudes__ I have my eye on.
- [ ] I would like to study by __ear__.
- [ ] __Styles__:
    - [ ] Classical style.
    - [ ] __Favorites__: __romantic__ era.
    - [ ] __Appreciate__ some: __barok__, some __Mozart__ etc.
    - [ ] __Not__ so much on the top of my list: __atonal__, the bulk of Mozart (sorry...)
- [ ] __Expression__:
    - [ ] __Not loud__ all the time.
    - [ ] Rhythm __rubato__/improvised over.
    - [ ] Mind phrasing, when applying expression tricks:
        - [ ] No sudden __staccato__, that has no context within the *phrasing*.
        - [ ] No sudden __drop in volume__, to appear dynamic, while having no context within the *phrasing*.
        - [ ] Context within the *phrasing* seems key here.
- [ ] __Mix__:
    - [ ] That I would like to __improvise__,
    - [ ] That I would like to __change__ things up.
    - [ ] Freely __mixing__ fragments of pieces creating a sort of mosaic.
    - [ ] __Leaving out__ parts I like less.
- [ ] __Imperfect__:
    - [ ] I might not go for playing  __perfectly__.
    - [ ] Allow __errors__.
    - [ ] Solve errors by __improvising__.
    - [ ] Be ok that things do not go perfectly at __recitals__.
    - [ ] The __stress__ of aiming for perfection, seems to harm the quality, cramping me up. So I might just let go of that and see performing as practice, with no aim to deliver the very best performance I could.
    - [ ] That all my aims and __goals__ are __optional__ and allowed to fail, be put on the back burner, be ineffective is ok. The hope things I try might be partly effective, but accumulation of skill is an upward slope. And even if it is not, maybe that's ok too.

### 2021-11-16 TODO List of Pieces to Play

- [ ] Listing of pieces that I play / have played / would like to play.

    - [ ] Would like the Spotify media to be nice to listen to.
    - [ ] Perhaps make playlists eventually and link to them.

### 2021-11-16 TODO Technique

- [ ] Rehearsing Barbara Lister-Sink suggestions.
- [ ] Barbara Lister-Sink Basic Stroke:
    - [ ] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjSWu8ZADzI" target="_blank">Basic Stroke</a>
    - [ ] Might still want to summarize that and add to:
    - [ ] [Barbara Lister-Sink's "Freeing the Caged Bird" Videos Summary](methods/barbara-lister-sink-freeing-the-caged-bird-videos-summary.md)
    - [ ] <a href="https://www.lister-sinkinstitute.org/freeing-the-caged-bird-dvd/#1508990586220-02706448-751f" target="_blank">DVD Contents / Ordering
    - [ ] I guess you'd really just have to buy the DVD for the entire thing (+/- 2.5 hours)
- [ ] Lower arm tension:
    - [ ] Tension in lower arm seems my pitfall.
    - [ ] I have tension in lower arm seemingly regardless of posture.
    - [ ] But of a few postures / motions seem to relieve the tension.
    - [ ] Other postures cramp up my forearm.
    - [ ] I would like to crack this puzzle.
- [ ] Wire in the way: might not improve technique without replacing it
- [ ] Piano Motion Symbols idea
    - [x] Considering Debussy Arabesque 1 motion annotations.
    - [x] Considering whatever motions comes to mind.
    - [x] Considering "Piano curriculum" doc "Motorische techniek".
    - [x] Considering "Piano Technique Ideas" doc.
    - [x] Considering loose idea docs
    - [x] Reorganized Piano folder.
    - [x] Less harsh wording in loose idea docs
    - [x] Digitizing what I have.
    - [ ] .. Systemizing more details.
    - [ ] Considering left-over things in "Piano Technique Ideas" under "2021-11-27 Brainstorm Motion Notation".
- [ ] Burgmüller Etudes for technique.
    - [ ] With those I show tension.
    - [ ] Perhaps it can be used to practice technique regarding tension.
    - [ ] But then in a slightly lighter setting.

Done

### 2022-01-13 Done GitHub Pages

- [x] Googling "convert markdown github to web page" leads to <a href="https://dev.to/bolajiayodeji/how-to-convert-github-markdown-files-to-a-simple-website-4e14" target="_blank">How to convert GitHub Markdown files to a simple website</a>
- [x] GitHub pages did not work yet. Waiting a while to see if it starts up automatically.
- [x] Renaming root README to have lower case extension .md helped.
- [x] Links to folders do not seem to work. Maybe also changing the file extension to lower case for those readme's.
- [x] Automatic links do not seem to work. Using the syntax `[Description](https:\\my-url)` may help.
- [x] Link to Archive seemed to not work: [Piano Playing Docs](https://jjvanzon.github.io/Piano-Playing-Docs/). Adding a README.md to that folder helped.
- [x] Perhaps adding author name and date to articles. It may be useful now that it is in web site form. Or perhaps only the date or only the month or year.
- [x] Horizontal lines:
    - [x] Grid rows with only dashes in it seemed to not render.
    - [x] Horizontal line `-----` seems interpreted as headings in bullet pointed lists.
    - [x] `<br/><br/>` seems an alternative for horizontal space in lists.
    - [x] `-----` formatted as inline code seems to help inside table rows.
- [x] Table layout seems applied inappropriately when using `|` in a bullet point's text. Replaced with commas `,`.
- [x] MarkDown (tables) nested in HTML tables showed the MarkDown literally inside the rendered page.
    - [x] Trying a trick `<td markdown="1">` from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15917463/embedding-markdown-in-jekyll-html" target="_blank">here</a> helped.
- [x] Links that start with slash, seem to use the wrong base URL and makes links break
    - [x] E.g. link to "/methods/practice-schema.md" does not seem to work.
    - [x] ~~baseurl in _config.yml did not help.~~
    - [x] ~~prefixing URL with {{ site.baseurl }} made link break in places other than GitHub Pages and GitHub pages would link to the .md instead of .html.~~
    - [x] Using absolute paths to the GitHub pages html page instead as a work-around.
- [x] No home link, like clicking on the logo.
    - [x] Back buttons instead.
    - [x] Adding `[back](./)` in a document
    - [x] And `[back](..)` in a folder or README.md.
- [x] "(MarkDown)" with a link does not seem to mean much on the GitHub Pages. Perhaps calling it "(Web Page)" instead.
- [x] Extra title "Piano Playing Docs" might be a bit redundant.
- [x] External links to open in new tab using `<a>` tags.
- [x] ~ More images at top of pages
