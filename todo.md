### 2021-11-16 TODO

- [ ] Changing fragment numbering for:
    - [ ] Chopin Ballade Ⅱ
    - [ ] Chopin Mazurka Op. 24, No. 2
- [ ] Publishing:
    - [x] Googling ["convert markdown github to web page"](https://dev.to/bolajiayodeji/how-to-convert-github-markdown-files-to-a-simple-website-4e14)
    - [x] GitHub pages did not work yet. Waiting a while to see if it starts up automatically.
    - [x] Renaming root README to have lower case extension .md helped.
    - [x] Links to folders do not seem to work. Maybe also change the file extension to lower case for those readme's.
    - [x] Automatic links do not seem to work here:
        - [x] [Barbara Lister-Sink’s “Freeing the Caged Bird” Videos Summary](https://jjvanzon.github.io/Piano-Playing-Docs/methods/barbara-lister-sink-freeing-the-caged-bird-videos-summary.html)    
    - [x] Link to Archive seems to not work: [Piano Playing Docs](https://jjvanzon.github.io/Piano-Playing-Docs/)
    - [ ] Perhaps add name and date to articles, now that it is in web site form it may be useful. Or perhaps only the date or only the month or year.
    - [ ] Table layout seems applied inappropriately for the "Changing B# => C" part in: [Sheet Music Simplification](https://jjvanzon.github.io/Piano-Playing-Docs/methods/sheet-music-simplification.html)
    - [ ] This might get prettier layout: [Fragment Subdivision](https://jjvanzon.github.io/Piano-Playing-Docs/methods/fragment-subdivision.html)
    - [ ] Grid rows with dashes seem skipped, e.g.:
        - [ ] [Practice Schema](https://jjvanzon.github.io/Piano-Playing-Docs/methods/practice-schema.html)
        - [ ] And other specific practice schemas.
    - [ ] Horizontal line `-----` seems interpreted as headings in: 
        - [ ] [Practice Schema](https://jjvanzon.github.io/Piano-Playing-Docs/methods/practice-schema.html)
        - [ ] [Analyses](https://jjvanzon.github.io/Piano-Playing-Docs/methods/analyses.html)
    - [ ] Link to /methods/practice-schema.md does not seem to translate well.
    - [ ] These analyses in MarkDown seems to not translate well:
        - [ ] [chopin-mazurka-op-24-no-2-harmonic-analysis](https://jjvanzon.github.io/Piano-Playing-Docs/chopin-mazurka-op-24-no-2/chopin-mazurka-op-24-no-2-harmonic-analysis.html)
        - [ ] [debussy-arabesque-1-chords-triads-only](https://jjvanzon.github.io/Piano-Playing-Docs/debussy-arabesque-1/debussy-arabesque-1-chords-triads-only.html)
