Chopin Mazurka Op. 24, No. 2 Practice
=====================================

*JJ van Zon, 2021-10-18*

I annotated the musical score, subdividing it into parts.  
For each part I might score myself 0 / 2 / 5 / 7 / 10 for different aspects: note reading / memorizing / technique / expression.  
To perhaps focus on things with lower scores.

Memorizing is a bit where it hangs right now.
Memorizing might also include memorizing the chords.
The note reading aspect might include annotating with mnemonics and cheats.  
Technique might include fingering.

So the parts below may be repeated and not consecutive.
