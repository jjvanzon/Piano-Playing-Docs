Chopin Mazurka Op. 24, No. 2
============================

Phrase Structure
----------------

Phrasing and repetition structure.  
There is a melody, base notes, unbroken chords/intervals, subtle contretemps.

|                       |             |
|:---------------------:|-------------|
|      __prefix__       | 1a          |
|  __verse - chorus__   | 2 - 3a      |
|   __intermezzo 1__    | 4           |
|  __verse - chorus__   | 2 - 3a - 3b |
| __intermezzos 2 & 3__ | 5a - 5b - 6 |
|  __verse - chorus__   | 2 - 3a      |
|      __suffix__       | 1b          |

### Part 1: Prefix & Suffix

In the beginning, part __1a__ is shorter.  
In the end part __1b__ is more elaborate, longer.  

It is mostly alternating intervals: 3rd - 6th - 3rd - 6th.

### Part 2: Verse

Repeated 3 times in the song.  
Has 2 similar halves.  
Structure:  
a - b - a' - b'  
The 2 halves differ by a trill like structure near the start.  
b is a transposed version of a, with different chords. Basically the minor counterpart chords.  
The 2nd time it repeats, the first chord is sustained slightly longer:  
a'' - b - a' - b'

Base notes sometimes differ from the chord's fundamental note.

### Part 3: Chorus

The verse (part __2__) is always followed by a chorus (part __3__).  
Repeated 3 times in the song.  
Structure:  
a - a - b - c  
a - a'- b - c  
The 2nd time with an extension (called part __3b__):  
d

Base notes correspond to the chord's fundamental note.

### Part 4: Intermezzo 1

Repeating the same chord progression 4 times.  
Structure:  
a1 - a2 - a3 - a4  
The melody is a playfully different variation each time.

Base note is mostly the same as the fundamental note of the chord.  
But for G⁷ the base note used is B (the 2nd note of the chord).

Trying to capture the structure of each melody variation:

- Taking 1st melody variation as base,  
- The 2nd melody variation throws itself a chord inversion further up in the 2nd measure, works itself down to a similar but not same 3th and 4th measure.
- The 3rd melody variation is quite similar to the 1st with a slight ornamentation at the beginning of the 3rd measure.
- The 4th melody variation seems based on equally timed 8th notes, then the ending is same as 3rd melody variation.

There are slight variations even still, not mentioned, but the above may help memorize things.

### Part 5: Intermezzo 2

Moves from C major to Dᵇ major (5 flats).  
It is structured rather regularly:  
a - b - a - c  
a - b - a a' - c'  
The a' and c' at the melody goes to the left hand (called part __5b__).

The base notes are the fundamentals of the chords.

### Part 6: Intermezzo 3

Intermezzo part __5__ is directly followed by intermezzo part __6__.  
It goes to minor.  
Melody in left hand.  
It basically repeats a theme 4 times.  
2nd time melody moves an octave lower.  
Structure:  
a - a - b - c  
a - a - b - c'  
(melody octave lower)  
a - a - b - c  
a - a - a' - a''

The base notes sometimes divert to a different tone than the fundamental of the chord.  
But basically because it is the melody.
