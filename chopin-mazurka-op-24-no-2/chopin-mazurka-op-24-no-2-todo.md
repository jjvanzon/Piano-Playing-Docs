### 2021-11-16 TODO Fragment 4 Memorizing and Phrase Structure

- [ ] I have some difficulty memorizing fragment 4.
- [ ] Might extend the phrase structure analysis for fragment 4.
- [ ] Perhaps splitting up in more pieces, and more specific how they repeat and recombine.
- [ ] (Rather than saying: 4 playful variations a1, a2, a3 and a4.)
- [ ] Maybe remove harmonic info from phrase structure analysis, since that may be already captured by the chord progression.

### 2021-11-16 TODO Memorizing

- [ ] I may want to memorize the *chords* too.
- [ ] (And after that, maybe even the *harmonic functions* (tonic, dominant, subdominant).
