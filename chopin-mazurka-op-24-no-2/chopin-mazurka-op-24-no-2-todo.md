============================

Done

### 2021-11 Done Tried Simplified Print

- [x] The simplified score with chords and phrase structure added might be too much for my brain to handle again.
- [x] Adding things to simplified score: some incidentals and perhaps fingering suggestions.
- [x] Re-printing simplified score (to omit phrase structure and chords again).
- [x] Adding part subdivision to re-printed simplified score.
- [x] Removing fingering from print again. (Changing too often.)
- [x] New simplified print might not add much to the heavily annotated version.
- [x] Problem is I need both the annotations and cannot process that much detail very fast.
