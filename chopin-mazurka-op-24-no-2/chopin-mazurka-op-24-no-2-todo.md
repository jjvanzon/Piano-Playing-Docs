Chopin Mazurka Op. 24, No. 2
============================

TODO

### 2021-11-16 TODO Part 4 Memorizing and Phrase Structure

- [ ] I have some difficulty memorizing part 4.
- [ ] Might extend the phrase structure analysis for part 4.
- [ ] Perhaps splitting up in more pieces, and more specific how they repeat and recombine.
- [ ] (Rather than saying: 4 playful variations a1, a2, a3 and a4.)

### 2021-11-16 TODO Memorizing

- [ ] I nearly memorized the *notes*.
- [ ] I may want to memorize the *chords* too.
- [ ] (And after that, maybe even the *harmonic functions* (tonic, dominant, subdominant).

### 2021-11-16 TODO Technique

- [ ] I was feeling more fluent motion.
- [ ] But then I was missing notes.
- [ ] Trying to regain control,
- [ ] I seem to become less fluent again.
- [ ] Maybe practice Barbara Lister-Sink's tips some more.
- [ ] Maybe put the piano bench lower?

Done

### 2021-11 Done Tried Simplified Print

- [x] The simplified score with chords and phrase structure added might be too much for my brain to handle again.
- [x] Adding things to simplified score: some incidentals and perhaps fingering suggestions.
- [x] Re-printing simplified score (to omit phrase structure and chords again).
- [x] Adding part subdivision to re-printed simplified score.
- [x] Removing fingering from print again. (Changing too often.)
- [x] New simplified print might not add much to the heavily annotated version.
- [x] Problem is I need both the annotations and cannot process that much detail very fast.
