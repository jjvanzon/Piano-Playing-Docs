Studying Notes
--------------

- [ ] Tried recording and reviewing.
- [ ] Phrasing seems 'gone'.
- [ ] Trying to ask from 'deep within'.
- [ ] Trying slow practice.
- [ ] Trying if arbitrary speed up and slow down still work.
- [ ] Philosophically:
    - [ ] Technique though limited, seems not the problem.
    - [ ] Expression technique is probably not it either.
    - [ ] It is the 'actual expression'.
    - [ ] I feel a bit down lately, walls put up, I may need to 'dig deeper'.
