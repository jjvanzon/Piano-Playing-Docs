Studying Notes
--------------

Mozarts composition style is steady paced. But steady playing is difficult for me. I like wavy, floating-around play.

- [x] Phrasing / heart felt: was on the decline once.
- [ ] But now technique seems a problem again.
- [ ] Trying if arbitrary speed up and slow down work for fluency.
- [ ] The 'connection points' (cross-overs, black keys, etc.) and 'join points' (where left and right hand meet up).
- [ ] They seem to be a point of attention and prone to muscle memory decline.
- [ ] Slow practice, focus on these join points, might be advisable.
- [ ] 'Minimal motion' seems to surface as an anti-practice here.
