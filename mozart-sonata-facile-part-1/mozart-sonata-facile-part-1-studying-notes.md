Studying Notes
--------------

### 2022-03-14 Sheet Music Simplification (MuseScore)

- [ ] In MuseScore "Load Style" might take care of the following:
    - [ ] Thicker lines
    - [ ] Bigger notes
    - [ ] Removing measure numbers.
    - [ ] Removing repeated key signatures.
    - [ ] Removing repeated clefs.
- [ ] Removing details:
    - [ ] In MuseScore, right clicking an element, then choosing  "Select" may show options that may help with this:
    - [ ] Removing the big accolades at the left.
    - [ ] Removing expression symbols (and pedal symbols, tempo, words, dynamics).
    - [ ] Removing expression bows.
    - [ ] Removing extension bows (and the repeated note).
    - [ ] Removing fingering numbers.
- [ ] Other details:
    - [ ] Removing 'announcing' key signatures at ends of lines.
    - [ ] Removing 'announcing' clef change.
    - [ ] Adding measure bars if there are none.
- [ ] Accidentals:
    - [ ] In MuseScore, using the "Plugins" menu, "Accidentals" and the options there may help with the following, though it's not perfect. (You may install it from [https://musescore.org/en/project/add-and-remove-courtesy-accidentals](https://musescore.org/en/project/add-and-remove-courtesy-accidentals)
    - [ ] Adding accidentals (even when part of key) (might take a few hours more).
    - [ ] Changing B# => C , Cb => B , E# => F , Fb => E.
    - [ ] Introducing key changes to prevent natural symbols <img src="https://jjvanzon.github.io/Piano-Playing-Docs/resources/natural-symbol.png" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle" />.
- [ ] Voices:
    - [ ] Removing some rest symbols.
    - [ ] Simplifying note durations / voicing notation.
    - [ ] Left hand / right hand separated and together.
- [ ] Layout:
    - [ ] Adding title (adding the word 'simplified').
    - [ ] Removing page headers and footers, mostly.
    - [ ] Adding page numbers (suggested font: Calibri 14pt).
    - [ ] Adjusted spacing between staves.
    - [ ] Adjusting spacing.
    - [ ] Adding double bar lines to separate more fragments.
    - [ ] Adjusting line ends to accommodate fragment subdivision.
    - [ ] Adjusting line ends to reflect the meter.
- [ ] Checking:
    - [ ] Checking by playing in editing software.
    - [ ] Checking by playing the print on a piano.
    - [ ] Correcting it.
    - [ ] Keep checking by playing the print, until no more corrections.

### 2022-03

Mozarts composition style is steady paced. But steady playing is difficult for me. I like wavy, floating-around play.

- [x] Phrasing / heart felt: was on the decline once.
- [ ] But now technique seems a problem again.
- [x] ~~'Minimal motion' seems to surface as an anti-practice here.~~ > Trying 'limp hand' technique instead.
- [x] ~~Trying if arbitrary speed up and slow down work for fluency.~~
- [x] ~~The 'connection points' (cross-overs, black keys, etc.) and 'join points' (where left and right hand meet up).~~ > Trying 'limp hand' technique instead.
- [ ] They seem to be a point of attention and prone to muscle memory decline.
- [ ] Slow practice, focus on these join points, might be advisable.

### 2022-03-10 Limp Hand

- [ ] Working on relaxed forearm.
- [ ] Difficulty feeling if it is relaxed or tense.
- [ ] It seems my *default* positioning of the hand, is with tense forearm, without my realizing. It just feels like 'normal' and even 'relaxed' to me.
- [ ] It might be a a *wrong habit*, hardwired.
- [ ] Limp hand might be the only time, I feel that it is totally relaxed.
- [ ] Limp hand does not seem *required* for relaxed forearm, but it seems the only time that I truly *feel* it.
- [ ] Limp hand seems to put my hand at a *tilted* position, unfortunately.
- [ ] Have been looking at muscle anatomy for hand and forearm, for inspiration on how to hold the hand. `[ Dutch ]`

    - [ ] <a href="https://wetenschap.infonu.nl/anatomie/89039-anatomie-spieren-en-functies-van-de-elleboog-en-bovenarm.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anatomy elbow / upper arm muscles (Dutch)</a>
- [ ] Trying to lower the bench, so a limp hand may more naturally reach the keys.

### 2022-03-10 Brainstorm Dynamics of Fast Movements

I feel that when notes go in rapid succession, to make it sound comfortable to the ear, some dynamics might help, where some notes are articulated, but others fall into the background. Because those rapid notes do not seem to register, as part of a normal-paced musical phrase. To make it work, they might sort of melt together.
