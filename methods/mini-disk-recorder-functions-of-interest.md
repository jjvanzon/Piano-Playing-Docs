MiniDisk Recorder Functions of Interest
=======================================

*JJ van Zon, 2022-04-26*

Went through the manual for "Sony Portable MiniDisk Recorder MZ-R35". Identified these functions that I'd like to remember.

From the manual:

- "Adjusting the recording level manually. (Manual recording)"
- "Emphasizing bass (DIGITAL MEGA BASS)": only for head phone out, not line out.
- "To erase a track"
- "Erasing a track mark"
