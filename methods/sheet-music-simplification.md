Sheet Music Simplification
--------------------------

- My mind might trip over all those details.  
- Scanning and editing score.  
- Might leave out most things except the notes themselves.
- Crop image.
- Brightness / contrast of the scan.
- Removing page headers and footers.
- Removing the big accolades at the left.
- Removing measure numbers.
- Removing fingering numbers.
- Removing repeated key signatures.
- Removing 'announcing' key signatures at ends of lines.
- Removing expression symbols (and pedal symbols, tempo, words, dynamics).
- Removing expression bows.
- Removing extension bows (and the repeated note).
- Removing some rest symbols.
- Removing repeated clefs.
- Removing 'announcing' clef change 
- Simplifying note durations / voicing notation.
- Adding accidentals (even when part of key) (might take a few hours more).
- Changing B# => C , Cb => B , E# => F , Fb => E.
- Adding title (adding the word 'simplified').
- Adding page numbers (font not too small).
- Notes small? Try rearranging measures.
- Checking clef change integrity.
- Checking copy-paste errors.
- Checking by playing the print.
- Correcting it.
- Keep checking by playing the print, until no more corrections.
- Might check with [image diff](https://online-image-comparison.com) before uploading.
