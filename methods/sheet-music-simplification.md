Description
-----------

I think this might make for an autism friendly version of sheet music for the piano.

I have autism and may be more distracted by visual details. Ignoring details may be beyond my control. That may be why note reading is extra difficult for me. I meant to leave out details that I might find distracting.

I removed things like headers, footers, words, numbers, tempo, dynamics, measure numbers, expression symbols, bows, pedal, accolades, fingering numbers, repeated clefts and key signatures.

Also I repeat accidentals (♭♯), because I cannot remember them very easily. Also avoiding B♯ C♭ E♯ F♭ if present. Also simplified note durations / voicing notation. Trying to keep right hand and left hand grouped and separated.

The lines are also a bit thicker and the notes a bit larger.

Sheet Music Simplification
--------------------------

### Checklist

- My mind might trip over all those details.  
- Might leave out most things except the notes themselves.
- Scanning and editing score.  
- Brightness / contrast of the scan (e.g. brightness +10%, contrast +10%).
- Crop image.
- Thicker lines
- Bigger notes
- Removing page headers and footers.
- Removing the big accolades at the left.
- Removing measure numbers.
- Removing fingering numbers.
- Removing repeated key signatures.
- Removing 'announcing' key signatures at ends of lines.
- Removing repeated clefs.
- Removing 'announcing' clef change.
- Removing expression symbols (and pedal symbols, tempo, words, dynamics).
- Removing expression bows.
- Removing extension bows (and the repeated note).
- Removing some rest symbols.
- Simplifying note durations / voicing notation.
- Left hand / right hand separated and together.
- Adding accidentals (even when part of key) (might take a few hours more).
- Changing B# => C , Cb => B , E# => F , Fb => E.
- Introducing key changes to prevent natural symbols <img src="https://jjvanzon.github.io/Piano-Playing-Docs/resources/natural-symbol.png" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle" />.
- Adding measure bars if there are none.
- Notes small? Try rearranging measures.
- Adding title (adding the word 'simplified').
- Adding page numbers (font not too small).
- Adjusting spacing.
- Adjusted spacing between staves.
- Checking clef change integrity.
- Checking copy-paste errors.
- Checking by playing the print.
- Correcting it.
- Keep checking by playing the print, until no more corrections.
