Sheet Music Simplification
--------------------------

### Checklist

- [ ] My mind might trip over all those details.  
- [ ] Might leave out most things except the notes themselves.
- [ ] Not needed in MuseScore:
    - [ ] Scanning and editing score.  
    - [ ] Brightness / contrast of the scan (e.g. brightness +10%, contrast +10%).
    - [ ] Crop image.
- [ ] In MuseScore "Load Style" might take care of the following:
    - [ ] Thicker lines
    - [ ] Bigger notes
    - [ ] Removing measure numbers.
    - [ ] Removing repeated key signatures.
    - [ ] Removing repeated clefs.
- [ ] Removing details:
    - [ ] In MuseScore, right clicking an element, then choosing  "Select" may help with this:
    - [ ] Removing the big accolades at the left.
    - [ ] Removing expression symbols (and pedal symbols, tempo, words, dynamics).
    - [ ] Removing expression bows.
    - [ ] Removing fingering numbers.
- [ ] Other details:
    - [ ] Removing extension bows (and the repeated note).
    - [ ] Removing 'announcing' key signatures at ends of lines.
    - [ ] Removing 'announcing' clef change.
    - [ ] Adding measure bars if there are none.
- [ ] Accidentals:
    - [ ] In MuseScore, using the "Plugins" menu, "Accidentals" and the options there may help with the following, though it's not perfect. (You may install it from [https://musescore.org/en/project/add-and-remove-courtesy-accidentals](https://musescore.org/en/project/add-and-remove-courtesy-accidentals))
    - [ ] Adding accidentals (even when part of key).
    - [ ] Repeating in-measure accidentals.
    - [ ] Changing B# => C , Cb => B , E# => F , Fb => E.
    - [ ] Introducing key changes to prevent natural symbols <img src="https://jjvanzon.github.io/Piano-Playing-Docs/resources/natural-symbol.png" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle" />.
    - [ ] Correcting unnecessary natural symbols.
- [ ] Voicing:
    - [ ] Removing some rest symbols.
    - [ ] Simplifying note durations / voicing notation.
    - [ ] Left hand / right hand separated and together.
- [ ] Layout:
    - [ ] Adding title (adding the word 'simplified').
    - [ ] Removing page headers and footers, mostly.
    - [ ] Adding page numbers (suggested font: Calibri 14pt).
    - [ ] Adjusting spacing between staves.
    - [ ] Adjusting spacing.
    - [ ] Consider vertical spacing of 5 or 6 lines per page.
    - [ ] Consider wide horizontal note spacing.
    - [ ] Consider regular amount of bars per line.
    - [ ] Adding double bar lines to separate more fragments.
    - [ ] Adjusting line ends to accommodate fragment subdivision.
    - [ ] Adjusting line ends to reflect the meter.
- [ ] Checking:
    - [ ] Checking clef change integrity.
    - [ ] Checking by playing in editing software.
    - [ ] Checking by playing the print on a piano.
    - [ ] Correcting it.
    - [ ] Keep checking by playing the print, until no more corrections.

### Description

I think this might make for an autism friendly version of sheet music for the piano.

I have autism and may be more distracted by visual details. Ignoring details may be beyond my control. That may be why note reading is extra difficult for me.

I removed things like headers, footers, words, numbers, tempo, dynamics, measure numbers, expression symbols, bows, pedal, accolades, fingering numbers, repeated clefs and key signatures.

Also I repeat accidentals (♭♯), because I cannot quite remember them while reading. Also avoiding B♯ C♭ E♯ F♭ if present. Also simplified note durations / voicing notation. Avoiding rest symbols if possible. Trying to keep right hand and left hand grouped and separated.

The lines are also a bit thicker and the notes a bit larger.
