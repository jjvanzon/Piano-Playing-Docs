Practice Schema
---------------

I may annotate musical score, subdividing it into fragments.

For each fragment I might score myself 0 / 2 / 5 / 8 / 10 for different aspects: note reading / memorizing / technique / expression.  
To perhaps focus on things with lower scores.

### Example Schema

| Fragment |   Read    | Memorize  | Technique |Expression |
|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|
| __1__    | - - 5 - - | - - 5 - - | - - - 8 - | - 2 - - - |
| __2__    | - - 5 - - | - 2 - - - | - - - 8 - |           |
| __3__    | - 2 - - - | - 2 - - - | - - 5 - - | - - 5 - - |
|`--------`|`---------`|`---------`|`---------`|`---------`|
| __4__    | - - 5 - - | - - - 8 - | - - - 8 - | - - - 8 - |
| __3'__   | - - - 8 - | - - - 8 - | - - 5 - - | - - - 8 - |
| __5__    | 0 - - - - | - - - 8 - | - - 5 - - | - - 5 - - |
|`--------`|`---------`|`---------`|`---------`|`---------`|
| __1'__   | - - - 8 - | - - - - 10| - - 5 - - | - 2 - - - |
| __6__    | - - 5 - - | - - 5 - - |           | - - 5 - - |
| __7__    | - - 5 - - | - - 5 - - | - - 5 - - | - - 5 - - |
| __8__    | - - - 8 - | - - 5 - - | - - - 8 - | - - 5 - - |
| __9__    | - - 5 - - | - 2 - - - | - - 5 - - | - 2 - - - |

### Details 

- Subdividing in __fragments__ may be the most useful step.
- Thinking in these 4 separate __aspects__ might help.
- Identifying things with __lower scores__, may help __focus__ efforts.
- __Writing down__ the scores may be less significant.
    - Once *memorization* scores are up, scores for *note reading* might matter less.
    - Once memorized, I might do the rest of the scoring in my head. Typing it in, may seem a bit laborious then.
    - A trick might be to score __everything__ with an __8__. Then selectively lower that score to __5__ for the fragments that desire some attention.
- __Acceptance__:
    - A score of 8 might be enough to move on.
    - When scores will not go up anymore, perhaps accept this as the end result.
    - Preventing perfectionism / frustration.
    - Depends how high you set the bar.
    <br/><br/>
- __Reading__:
    - Might include annotating with mnemonics and cheats.  
    - May include my making simplified musical score or chord progressions.
- __Memorizing__:
    - Analyzing phrase and repetition structure may help.
    - Memorizing might at one point include memorizing the chords.  
- __Technique__:
    - Might include fingering.
    - Annotating the musical score with arrows/symbols how to move.
    - Figuring out tricks for the harder fragments.
- __Expression__:
    - It may be a bit difficult to judge the expression without hearing back a recording.
