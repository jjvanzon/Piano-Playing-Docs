Extended Fingering Notation
---------------------------

This is an idea of extending fingering notation from just numbers to additional symbols, indicating the kind hand of movement involved.

| Symbol | Name                     | Sense         | Description       
|:------:|--------------------------|---------------|-----------------
|   ⨯    | Cross over               | Semi-smooth   | Cross over finger over thumb or thumb under finger.
|   ↓    | Gravity assist           | Smooth        | Fall in key with gravity, with thumb or other finger.
|   ∩    | Pivot                    | Smooth        | Pivot wrist
|   ⤸    | Jump                     | Semi-smooth   | Jumping sideways.
|   –    | Switch finger            | Semi-smooth   | Same key pressed 2nd time with different finger.
|   ｜   | Switch finger (in place) | Bit confusing | Existing notation. Example: 1｜5 
|   ⟵   | Reach sideways           | Semi-tense    | Reach sideways, let go, move hand.
|   ⟶   | "                        | "             | "
|  ⟷    | Stretch                  | Tense         | Stretch fingers wider.
|   ↑    | Reach towards black keys | Not preferred | Prefer cross over.
|   ↷    | Cross over / wrist turn  | Not preferred | Cross over fingers with wrist turn assisted by arm. Prefer reach sideways.
