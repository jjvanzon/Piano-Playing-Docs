Finger Numbers
--------------

These might be personal preferences for writing finger numbers in musical score.

- Finger numbers with *most* notes.
- Written down in *straight* lines.
- Above or below the *bar*: with a bit of consistency.
- *walks* of continuous notes:
    - Might leave out certain finger numbers, except:
    - At a *start* of a walk.
    - At the *end* of a walk.
    - Before and after *cross-over*.
    - Jumps of *more* than one note.
    - When *not obvious*.
- Strongly *repeating* patterns might not repeat fingering.
