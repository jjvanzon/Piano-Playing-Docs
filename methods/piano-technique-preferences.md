Piano Technique Preferences
---------------------------

Some personal preferences for piano technique. It is all still a bit of guesswork here. The focus appears to be general posture for now.

### Posture

Trying to find a posture, to play with more freedom, adapted to my body type.

### Body Type

My body type is:

- Shorter
- More hunched.
- Shoulders hunched forward
- Back hunched or straight
- Back not curved inward.

Rather than bad posture, maybe accept this as my body type. Even a physical therapist had to conclude, that my back is just not curved that way. It's been that way since late childhood. It may not affect my piano playing positively. I try to compensate my posture, at the same time accepting my body as it is.

### Lower Arm

- quite a bit *slanted* downward.

### Upper Arm

- at a bit of a a *forward-down* diagonal.
 
### Back

- Straight
- Slightly *tilted backwards*.

This way, as the fingers rest on the keyboard,  
they seem to want to fall closer to the body.  
This seems to make the *weight* on the fingers come from the *torso* more passively,  
instead of *actively* from the (lower) arms and wrist. 

### Shoulders

- The general suggestion seems to be to let the shoulders hang down.
- I appear to have not much problem with that.
- Mine hang down forward.
- That appears to be my body type.

### Seating

- To help maintain this position:
- Bench at quite a high setting.
- Wearing shoes, so I still reach the floor naturally.
- At moderate distance from piano.  
- Using the closer half of the seat.

### Arms

- Depending on the situation, somewhere in between:
- Lower arm forward / elbow outward OR
- Lower arm forward-sideward / elbow inward.

### Torso

- This posture may make *force* come from the *torso*.
- Swaying torso for support.
- Positioning at average distance between the keys pressed.

### Fingers & Wrist

- Motion may be desired from the fingers and wrist for control.
- They might move more freely and independent with this posture.
- Labor might be diverted to the fingers or the wrist arbitrarily or alternatingly.

### Melodic Passages

- The above may work for melodic passages.  

### Chords / Jumps

- For chords I may sit slightly more tilted forward.
- Force might need to come from the arms a bit more.
- With more lifting of the wrist and lower arm.

### Experiment

- I might experiment deviating from these suggestions,  
- to make weight/force come from different parts of the body,  
- to start actively feeling this,  
- and getting a musical effect from it.
- Perhaps regard any variation on distribution of weight as welcome,  
- as well as the playing style that results from it.
