Rehearsal Marks
---------------

### Introduction

Adding annotations to sheet music to denote subdivision into fragments. Individual memorization or attention to technique may be desired for each fragment when studying it.

### Guidelines

- Rehearsal numbers:
    - Might be numbered:
    - `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`
- Sub-fragments:
    - Might use a dot (`.`) notation:
    - `1.1`, `1.2`, `1.3`.
- Fragment variations:
    - When fragments are variations on previous fragments, an apostrophe (`'`) might be used:
    - `1`, `1'`, `2`, `2'`.
    - Additional variations, more apostrophes might stack up:
    - `2`, `2'`, `2''`, `2'''`.
- Larger parts:
    - Might be denoted in a [practice schema](practice-schema.md) with horizontal lines, separating groups of fragments.

That way the structure of the piece might hopefully be reflected in the numbering of fragments.

### Example

Fragment numbers might look like this:

__1.1__  
__1.2__  
__1.3__  
__2__  
__3.1__  
__3.2__  
__3.3__  
__1.1'__  
-----  
__4__  
__5.1__  
__5.2__  
__6.1__  
__6.2__  
__6.3__  
__7.1__  
__7.2__  
__8__  
__7.1'__  
__7.2'__  
-----  
__1.1'__  
__1.2__  
__1.3__  

### Description

Simplified sheet music with rehearsal marks (1, 2, 3, 4.1, 4.2, etc.) and stereotyped fragments (prefix, verse, chorus, etc.) which may help memorize.

It is visually simplified. More readable considering my autism, making me more distracted by visual details beyond my control.

Removed things like headers, footers, words, numbers, tempo, dynamics, measure numbers, expression symbols, bows, pedal, accolades, repeated clefs and key signatures. Also repeated accidentals (♭ ♯), because I cannot remember them very easily. Also simplified note durations / voicing notation.

The lines are also a bit thicker and the notes a bit larger.
