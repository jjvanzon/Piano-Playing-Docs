Piano Playing Docs
==================

*2021-11-16 JJ van Zon*

Piano playing is a hobby of mine. Here I try to organize my thoughts about it. And share documents I may make.

I may have difficulty reading notes, memorizing pieces, finding a good technique and motor control.  
I have some thoughts about how playing might be made more expressive.  

I try to support these goals with the content found here.
