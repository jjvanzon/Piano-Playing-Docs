Piano Playing Docs
==================

*2021-11-16 JJ van Zon*

Piano playing is a hobby of mine.  
Here I try to organize my thoughts about it.  
And share documents I may make.  

I may have difficulty memorizing pieces, finding a good technique and motor control.  
I have some thoughts about how playing might be made more expressive.  

I try to support these goals with the content found here.
