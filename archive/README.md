Older but somehow difficult to delete content.

- [Piano Motion Symbols Archive](piano-motion-symbols-archive.md)

    - Symbols currently out of favor.

- [Satie GymnopÃ©die â…  Sheet Music with Simplified Notation (Old)](satie-gymnopedie-1-sheet-music-simplified-notation-old/README.md)

    - Paint.NET-edited version replaced by MuseScore-edited version.

- [Chopin Mazurka Op. 24, No. 2 Sheet Music with Simplified Notation Old](chopin-mazurka-op-24-no-2-sheet-music-simplified-notation-old/README.md)

    - Paint.NET-edited version replaced by MuseScore-edited version.

- [Mozart-Sonata Facile Part 1 Sheet Music with Simplified Notation Tight](mozart-sonata-facile-part-1-sheet-music-simplified-notation-tight.mscx)

    - Tighter packed notes, which look quite nice as a whole, but works less well for me, when reading it measure by measure, than the wider-spaced version that replaced it.
