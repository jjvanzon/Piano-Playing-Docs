Studying Notes
--------------

### Expression
    
- Felt Upright nice for this
- p loud enough
- Slow
- Keep simultaneity
- Micro-dynamics in soft-range
- Micro-timing durations (keeping simultaneous)
- Per fragment:
    - Prefix and verse does not need much to sound nice.
    - Chorus bit less soft, more expressive.
    - Bridge bit soft and mysterious
    - Finale more pronounced and 'made special'.

### Technique

- The 9ths are hard to grasp.
