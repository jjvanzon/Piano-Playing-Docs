### Expression
    
- Felt Upright nice for this
- p loud enough
- Slow
- Keep simultaneity
- Micro-dynamics in soft-range
- Micro-timing durations (keeping simultaneity)
- Per fragment:
    - Prefix and verse does not need much, to sound nice.
    - Chorus bit less soft, more expressiveness.
    - Bridge bit soft and mysterious
    - Finale more pronounced and 'made special'.

### Technique
