Preparation for Performance on April 1, 2022
--------------------------------------------

### Philosophy

***Analyses*** rather than piece-learning. Am behind on that.  
That way, nothing new to play next performance, perhaps.  
My choice, not others. 

### Checklist

 All optional. By priority:

- [ ] ***Analyses:***
    - [ ] [Sheet Music Simplification](methods/sheet-music-simplification.md)
        - [ ] In MuseScore.
        - [ ] For all pieces.
    - [ ] ... [Satie - Gnossienne Ⅰ](satie-gnossienne-1/README.md)
        - [ ] (Without analyses I may have trouble memorizing.)
        - [ ] Phrase structure analysis
        - [ ] Chords
- [ ] ***Technique:***
    - [ ] ... [Piano Motion Symbols](methods/piano-motion-symbols.md) with [Mozart Sonata Facile Part 1](mozart-sonata-facile-part-1/README.md) as practice material.
- [ ] ***Repertoire:***
    - [ ] ... [Satie](pieces-to-play.md#might-study-next) easier piece.
    - [ ] ... Extending [Pieces to Play](pieces-to-play.md) document.
