### 2022-03-14 Sheet Music Simplification

- [x] In MuseScore "Load Style" might take care of the following:
    - [x] Thicker lines
    - [x] Bigger notes
    - [x] Removing measure numbers.
    - [x] Removing repeated key signatures.
    - [x] Removing repeated clefs.
- [x] Removing details:
    - [x] In MuseScore, right clicking an element, then choosing  "Select" may show options that may help with this:
    - [x] Removing the big accolades at the left.
    - [x] Removing expression symbols (and pedal symbols, tempo, words, dynamics).
    - [x] Removing expression bows.
    - [x] ~~Removing fingering numbers.~~
- [x] Other details:
    - [x] Removing extension bows (and the repeated note).
    - [x] ~~Removing 'announcing' key signatures at ends of lines.~~
    - [x] ~~Removing 'announcing' clef change.~~
    - [x] ~~Adding measure bars if there are none.~~
- [x] Voicing:
    - [x] Removing some rest symbols.
    - [x] Simplifying note durations / voicing notation.
    - [x] Left hand / right hand separated and together.
- [x] Accidentals
    - [x] ~~In MuseScore, using the "Plugins" menu, "Accidentals" and the options there may help with the following, though it's not perfect. (You may install it from [https://musescore.org/en/project/add-and-remove-courtesy-accidentals](https://musescore.org/en/project/add-and-remove-courtesy-accidentals)~~
    - [x] Adding accidentals (even when part of key). > Removed signature (1-flat).
    - [x] ~~Introducing key changes to prevent natural symbols <img src="https://jjvanzon.github.io/Piano-Playing-Docs/resources/natural-symbol.png" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle" />.~~
    - [x] Repeating in-measure accidentals.
    - [x] Correcting unnecessary natural symbols.
    - [ ] See [b and # reasons](https://jjvanzon.github.io/Piano-Playing-Docs/methods/sheet-music-simplification.html#b-and--reasons).
- [x] Layout:
    - [x] Adding title (adding the word 'simplified').
    - [x] Removing page headers and footers, mostly.
    - [x] Adding page numbers (suggested font: Calibri 14pt).
    - [x] Adjusting spacing between staves.
    - [x] Adjusting spacing.
    - [x] Consider wide horizontal note spacing.
    - [x] Adjusting line ends to reflect the meter.
    - [x] Consider regular amount of bars per line.
    - [x] Clefs at page 10 went through notes.
    - [x] Adjusting line ends to accommodate fragment subdivision.
    - [x] Adding double bar lines to separate more fragments.
    - [x] Smaller time signature numbers (coinciding less with other lines).
- [x] Exceptional cases
    - [x] Slow arpeggio with strange measure.
    - [x] There are certain bar line that are 2x thicker. It appears to be 2 bar lines right next to each other.
- [ ] Checking:
    - [x] Checking by playing in editing software.
    - [x] Checking by playing the print on a piano.
        - [x] I am torn between choosing either # or b consistently, chord shapes and intervals not looking what they look like. Sometimes those things clash.
        - [x] ~~Trying to balance it out, I tend to get a Eb and a F# in one measure where I am at now.~~
    - [x] Corrections:
        - [x] Might go for less lines a page, more pages.
        - [x] May choose # or b more consistently (per measure?)
    - [x] Correcting it.
    - [x] Checking print again.
    - [x] Correcting it again.
    - [x] Checking by playing in editing software.
    - [ ] Checking print again.
        - [ ] Only correct if very good reason.
    - [ ] Keep checking by playing the print, until no more corrections.
- [ ] Variation of sheet music, with *reason* for b or #:
    - [ ] __... Adding reasons to draft simplified sheet music.__
