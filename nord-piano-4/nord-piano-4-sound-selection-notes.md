TODO

### 2021-10-27 TODO Factory Defaults: Organizing & Exporting

- [ ] Sound previews in GitHub would be nice, but quite some work.
- [ ] Publishing
    - [ ] Perhaps be bold and ask Clavia if I can go public (with a sub-license?).

### 2021-09 Done Factory Defaults Selection

- [x] Restoring backup with many factory sounds still in there.
- [x] Removing less-desired samples.
- [x] Exporting banks.
- [x] Restoring backup with good selections.
- [x] Grouping categories.
- [x] Sorting by instrument type and timbre.

    - [x] Combos Misc

        - [x] Metallic Hammers
        - [x] Duo Lines
        - [x] Innocence
        - [x] Mellow Vibes
        - [x] Mellow Pizz
    - [x] Not sure I need the 12 Strings Guitar. Choose an alternative?

### 2021-10 Done BUG: Combo / sample / piano link bug:

- [x] The combos have different samples than when I imported them... did the software randomly pick a different sample?
- [x] Obs: when I relink either the piano or sample of a program that had both of them unlinked, the one I do not relink seems to get set to an arbitrary default.
- [x] I seem to have v7.62. I think I see a v7.64 online. Perhaps they fixed it.
- [x] Does not seem so.
- [x] It seems the sample's settings might also not be yielded over if sample is missing (like its volume). (With Crying Grand the sample volume was -0 dB, while it seems it was supposed to be -25 dB or something.)
- [x] What might happen when importing the missing sample afterwards. Are settings ok? Crying Grand is a bit of a good test case, since the volume of the sample is supposed to be way down if imported correctly.
- [x] It appears I might need to look at my documentation to see what the sample and piano are supposed to be, to get it right.

### 2021-10-20 Done Factory Defaults: Organizing & Exporting

- [x] So that I can easily load individual factory default sounds.
- [x] Reverting back to factory defaults.
- [x] Grouping programs into categories:
- [x] Processing uncategorized programs.
- [x] Sorting banks internally
- [x] Correcting sounds in wrong category.
    - [x] Might put wrong matches at the end of a bank.
    - [x] And then in the Uncategorized bank.
    - [x] Then redistributing to right category.
    - [x] Moving around banks.
    - [x] Internally ordering banks again.
- [x] Categorizing samples.
    - [x] Sub-categorizing Mellotron sounds.
    - [x] Internally organizing categories.
        - [x] Piano Samples
        - [x] Electric Piano Samples
        - [x] Organs
        - [x] Accordions
        - [x] Tuned Percussion

        - [x] Synth String
        - [x] Synth Pad
        - [x] Synth Lead
        - [x] Synth Base
        - [x] Edge cases:
            - [x] Making program and sample categories match.
            - [x] Reconsidering separate Mellotron sample categories.
            - [x] Making more precise.
            - [x] Last look
            - [x] I cannot seem to grasp the String Solo subdivision. I give up I guess. This might have to do.
- [x] Backing up.
- [x] Exporting one by one in category folders (programs, samples and pianos).
    - [x] Pianos
    - [x] Pianos Sampled
    - [x] Piano Combos

    - [x] Combos Misc
    - [x] Split
    - [x] Percussion (for Orchestral Mellotron sample)
- [x] Adding a README to the export folder.
- [x] Edge cases:
    - [x] Tidying up the banks / sample lists.
    - [x] Restoring deleted String Solo README.
    - [x] Electric piano program "Silence Mk I" accidentally exported as bundle. Exporting as program instead.
    - [x] Ladder Bass
        - [x] I decided is a Synth Lead.
        - [x] Moved the sample, but not the program.
        - [x] In the "Factory Defaults Organized".
        - [x] Can do it in the folders.
    - [x] Grouping some shorter README's into one.
        - [x] Brainstorm:
            - [x] Not so much the folders, the README's.
            - [x] Perhaps not delete detail readme's.
            - [x] Perhaps extend main readme's.
        - [x] Folders:
            - [x] Piano Combos
            - [x] Electric Pianos Etc
            - [x] Electric Pianos Etc > Wurlitzer
            - [x] Electric Pianos Etc > Electric Pianos
            - [x] Electric Pianos Etc > Misc
            - [x] Electric Pianos Etc Combos
- [x] GitHub repository
    - [x] Private, with README's, a navigable like a web site.
- [x] Testing if it is usable.
    - [x] I used the GitHub to browse.
    - [x] But the local folder for the files.
    - [x] The whole is pretty usable, I think.
    - [x] Rework:
        - [x] Piano with FX to reflect selections in my main banks.
        - [x] Combo references to samples and piano files in README.
            - [x] Piano Combos
            - [x] Electric Piano Etc Combos\
            - [x] Combos Misc
            - [x] Split
            - [x] Elsewhere
        - [x] Moving Ladder Base.
        - [x] Sample and program order consistency.
            - [x] Tuned Percussion
            - [x] Woodwind
            - [x] Brass Ensemble
            - [x] String Ensemble
            - [x] Synth Lead (hard to find order)
    - [x] Formatting links:
        - [x] Clearer what is a program, sample and where is the piano file.
        - [x] Piano link for each combo.
        - [x] Only these categories seem a bit ambiguous about it:
            - [x] Piano Combos
            - [x] Electric Pianos Etc Combos
        - [x] Making piano links more descriptive
            - [x] Added longer name.
            - [x] But left out version number.
        - [x] ~~Sub-folder for each combo?~~
            - [x] ~~with the file and a readme in it,~~
            - [x] ~~with links to both sample and piano file.~~
            - [x] ~~Would that make too many sub-folders?~~
        - [x] ~~Program links not under title, but separate headed by "Program:" (for clarity)?~~
        - [x] I do require sometimes when importing a program, to look in a different folder for the sample. I am not sure that makes it of lesser interest.
        - [x] Searching only master branch might be desirable. > Is probably what happens.

### 2021-10-14 Done ~~Switching to Nord Piano 5~~

Stopped this. Returning the Nord Piano 5, because it is not compatible with Nord Sample Library 3.0. Also I cannot transfer any sounds from Nord Piano 4 to Nord Piano 5 (incompatible).

- [x] ~~Software for Nord Piano 5~~ > Already up to date.
- [x] Backing up Nord Piano __5__ factory defaults
    - [x] Backing up Nord Piano __5__ factory default as bulk backup.
    - [x] Backing up Nord Piano __5__ factory default separate programs.
- [x] Backing up customizations:
    - [x] Backing up Nord Piano __4__ customized banks (bulk backup).
    - [x] Backing up Nord Piano __4__ customized banks (bundles).
    - [x] Backing up Nord Piano __4__ customized programs (bundles).
    - [x] Backing up Nord Piano __4__ customized sound files.
- [x] Compatibility problem:
    - [x] Cannot seem to import Nord Piano 4 exports into Nord Piano 5.
    - [x] I am guessing more manual work then.
    - [x] Nord Sample Library 3.0 seems not compatible with Nord Piano 5.
    - [x] This might be a deal breaker then.
    - [x] Nord Sample Editor 4
        - [x] ~~Might it be able to convert?~~
    - [x] No there seems no way.
- [x] ~~Storage space low~~
    - [x] ~~The bundles folder is getting huge ("Nord Piano 5 Factory Defaults\Programs").~~
    - [x] Maybe "Upload Sound" might be a better command to use.
    - [x] ~~Maybe that might allow importing the Nord Piano 4 sounds too.~~
- [x] ~~Backing up Nord Piano __4__ factory defaults:~~
    - [x] ~~Restoring Nord Piano __4__ factory defaults.~~
    - [x] ~~Backing up Nord Piano __4__ factory default separate programs.~~
- [x] ~~Moving customizations to Nord Piano __5__:~~
    - [x] ~~Organizing sounds of Nord Piano __5__ to mimic customizations on Nord Piano 4.~~
- [x] ~~Sound selections:~~
    - [x] ~~Selecting Nord Piano __5__ factory defaults one by one.~~
    - [x] ~~Adding Nord Sample Library 3.0 Sound Collections sounds.~~
    - [x] ~~Upgrading piano sounds.~~
