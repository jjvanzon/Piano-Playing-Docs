Repertoire Building
-------------------

- See [Pieces to Play](pieces-to-play.md)

Performing
----------

- Performing at a local ***get-together***.
- Eventually an ***hour*** of back-ground music at a ***event***.

Skill Learning
--------------

Current focus:

- Balancing ***technique & expression***.  
- ***Chords***, harmony, improvisation.

Skills:

- ***Note reading:***
    - May include ***simplifying*** musical score.
- ***Memorization:***
    - Discovering ***structures*** in the music.
- ***Technique:***
    - Studying ***motion*** of the ***body*** in detail.
    - Studying ***arpeggios*** and ***scales*** and such.
    - Technique good enough to not just ***stomp*** through a piece, but also ***feeling well*** and having the ***control*** to add ***expression***.
- ***Expression:***
    - Studying ***'color palette'*** of piano sound.
    - ***Respecting*** any note / chord / sound / way of playing as welcome.
- ***Harmonics:***
    - Working out / learning the ***chords*** of classical piano pieces.
    - Developing ***harmonic insight*** into chords and such.
        - For better memorization.
        - To improvise myself out of a mistake.
        - To improvise for entertainment purposes.
- ***Recording:***
    - For reflection.
    - To put online.
    - For entertainment.
- ***Sharing:***
    - Most of the things I produce I might put online, including recordings, chords and simplified sheet music and other analyses.

Styles & Attitudes
------------------

- ***Philosophy:***
    - Going for ***imperfect*** piano playing.
    - Obtaining ***skills*** to compensate.
    - ***Improvisation*** might be key.
    - Things may go wrong on any aspect: note reading / memorizing / technique / motor skills / expression / listening / performing
- Studying by ***ear*** more.
    <br/><br/>
- ***Styles:***
    - ***Classical*** style.
    - ***Romantic*** era is favorite.
    - ***Solo piano*** by default.
    - ***Barok*** side-ways appreciated
    - ***Mozart*** sometimes appreciated, but less.
- ***Not:***
    - ***Atonal*** rather not.
    - ***Fast*** like a ***race*** not preferred.
    - ***Fear*** expression not preferred.
    - ***Anger*** expression not too much.
    - ***Grandeur*** not something I identify with.
    - ***Loud*** not preferred.
    - ***Voices*** rather not.
- ***Expression:***
    - ***Not loud*** all the time.
    - ***Rubato*** rhythm / improvised over.
    - ***Phrasing*** is something to mind, when applying expression tricks:
        - No sudden ***staccato***, that has no context within the *phrasing*.
        - No sudden ***drop in volume***, to appear dynamic, while having no context within the *phrasing*.
        - Context within the *phrasing* seems key here.
- ***Imperfect:***
    - ***Imperfect*** playing might be what I am going for.
    - ***Errors*** allowed.
    - ***Improvising*** used for error solving.
    - ***Recitals*** are ok to go imperfectly.
    - ***Stress*** of aiming for perfection, seems to harm the quality, cramping me up. So I might just let go of that and see performing as *practice*, with no aim to deliver the very best performance I could.
    - ***Goals*** are ***optional*** and allowed to fail. Hopefully gradual accumulation of skill as a side-effect.
- ***Mix:***
    - ***Improvising*** over things.
    - ***Changing*** things up.
    - ***Mixing*** fragments of pieces, creating a sort of mosaic.
    - ***Leaving out*** parts I like less.

Background
----------

I have had this piano playing hobby for quite some years since youth. I have had music lessons too. I have had it on a break from time to time. I am giving it a spin again, to have something to do.

I have autism and health problems both physical and mentally. That may limit what I might achieve. Things may work differently for me. I might adapt the way I approach things, to what seems to work better for me.

The music hobby may be a way to therapeutically train (cognitive) capabilities that have diminished.

Further Future
--------------

Playing in a ***band***?  
Not any time soon. Unlikely because of health issues.
