Background
----------

I have had this piano playing hobby for quite some years since youth. I have had music lessons too. I have had it on a break from time to time. I am giving it a spin again, to have something to do.

I have autism and health problems both physical and mentally. That may limit what I might achieve. Things may work differently for me. I might adapt the way I approach things, to what seems to work better for me.

The music hobby may be a way to therapeutically train (cognitive) capabilities that have diminished.
