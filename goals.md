Goals
=====

[back](./)

- My goal might not be to play the piano ***perfectly***, but more to be able 'to ***save myself*** out a situation'.
    - On any aspect: note reading / memorizing / technique / motor skills / expression / listening / performing.
    - Things may go wrong in any area, but it would be nice if I would have tools to get myself out of a pickle.
- An intermediate goal could be to learn to play ***one piece*** moderately.
    - And performing it at a local ***get-together*** I have in mind.
    - Specifically [Chopin Mazurka Op. 24, No. 2](chopin-mazurka-op-24-no-2)
- Another intermediate goal might be to try and learn ***four classical piano pieces*** of different sorts and levels:
    - [Chopin Mazurka Op. 24, No. 2](chopin-mazurka-op-24-no-2)
    - [Debussy Arabesque Ⅰ](debussy-arabesque-1)
    - [Mozart Sonata "Facile" Part 1](mozart-sonata-facile-part-1-practice-schema.md)
    - [Chopin Ballade Ⅱ](chopin-ballade-2)
- A futher goal might be to be able to fill an ***hour*** playing moderately entertaining classical piano music.
    - I might like to perform that hour of piano music at an ***event*** I have in mind.
- Playing in a ***band*** might be a goal for the futher future, because that is not something I am likely to handle health-wise any time soon.

Background
----------

I have had this piano playing hobby for quite some years since youth. I have had music lessons too. I have had it on a break from time to time. I am giving it a spin again, to have something to do.

I have autism and health problems both physical and mentally. That may limit what I might achieve. Things may work differently for me. I might adapt the way I approach things, to what seems to work better for me.

The music hobby may be a way to therapeutically train (cognitive) capabilities that have diminished.
