Repertoire Building
-------------------

- See [Pieces to Play](pieces-to-play.md)

Performing
----------

- Performing at a local ***get-together***:
- Eventually an ***hour*** of back-ground music at a ***event***.

Skill Learning
--------------

Current focus:

- Balancing ***technique & expression***.  
- ***Chords***, harmony, improvisation.

Philosophy:

- Going for ***imperfect*** piano playing.
- Obtaining ***skills*** to compensate.
- ***Improvisation*** might be key.
- On any aspect: note reading / memorizing / technique / motor skills / expression / listening / performing
- Things may go wrong.

Specific skills:

- ***Note reading:***
    - May include ***simplifying*** musical score.
- ***Memorization:***
    - Discovering ***structures*** in the music.
- ***Technique:***
    - Studying ***motion*** of the ***body*** in detail.
    - Studying ***arpeggios*** and ***scales*** and such.
    - Technique good enough to not just ***stomp*** through a piece, but also ***feeling well*** and having the ***control*** to add ***expression***.
- ***Expression:***
    - Studying ***'color palette'*** of piano sound.
    - ***Respecting*** any note / chord / sound / way of playing as welcome.
- ***Harmonics:***
    - Working out / learning the ***chords*** of classical piano pieces.
    - Developing ***harmonic insight*** into chords and such.
        - For better memorization.
        - To improvise myself out of a mistake.
        - To improvise for entertainment purposes.
- ***Recording***:
    - Might record my playing.
    - For reflection.
    - To put online, perhaps.
    - For entertainment purposes, hopefully.
- ***Sharing***:
    - Most of the things I produce I might put online, including chords and simplified sheet music and other analyses, and possibly in the future recordings too.

Styles & Attitudes
------------------

- I would like to study by ***ear***.
    <br/><br/>
- ***Styles***:
    - Classical style.
    - ***Favorites***: ***romantic*** era.
    - ***Appreciate*** some: ***barok***, some ***Mozart*** etc.
    - ***Not*** so much on the top of my list: ***atonal***, the bulk of Mozart (sorry...)
- ***Expression***:
    - ***Not loud*** all the time.
    - Rhythm ***rubato***/improvised over.
    - Mind phrasing, when applying expression tricks:
        - No sudden ***staccato***, that has no context within the *phrasing*.
        - No sudden ***drop in volume***, to appear dynamic, while having no context within the *phrasing*.
        - Context within the *phrasing* seems key here.
- ***Mix***:
    - I would like to ***improvise***,
    - I would like to ***change*** things up.
    - Freely ***mixing*** fragments of pieces creating a sort of mosaic.
    - ***Leaving out*** parts I like less.
- ***Imperfect***:
    - I might go for playing  ***imperfectly***.
    - Allowing ***errors***.
    - Solving errors by ***improvising***.
    - Be ok that things do not go perfectly at ***recitals***.
    - The ***stress*** of aiming for perfection, seems to harm the quality, cramping me up. So I might just let go of that and see performing as *practice*, with no aim to deliver the very best performance I could.
    - That all my aims and ***goals*** are ***optional*** and allowed to fail, be put on the back burner, be ineffective is ok. Hopefully amounting to a gradual accumulation of skill. And if not, maybe that's ok too.

Background
----------

I have had this piano playing hobby for quite some years since youth. I have had music lessons too. I have had it on a break from time to time. I am giving it a spin again, to have something to do.

I have autism and health problems both physical and mentally. That may limit what I might achieve. Things may work differently for me. I might adapt the way I approach things, to what seems to work better for me.

The music hobby may be a way to therapeutically train (cognitive) capabilities that have diminished.

Further Future
--------------

Playing in a ***band***?  
Not any time soon. Unlikely because of health issues.
