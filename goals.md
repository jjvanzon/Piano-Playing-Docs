Piano Playing Docs
==================

Goals
-----

- My goal might not be to play the piano ***perfectly***, but more to be able 'to ***save myself*** out a situation'.
    - On any aspect: note reading / memorizing / technique / motor skills / expression / listening: Things may go wrong in any area, but it would be nice if I would have tools to get myself out of a pickle.
- An intermediate goal could be to perform ***one piece*** moderately at a local ***get-together*** I have in mind.
- Another intermediate goal might be to try and learn ***four classical piano pieces*** of different sorts and levels.
- An futher goal might be to be able to fill an ***hour*** playing moderately entertaining classical piano music.
    - Along the same direction I would like to perform that hour of piano music at an ***event*** I have in mind.
- Playing in a ***band*** might be a goal for the futher future, because that is not something I am likely to handle health-wise any time soon.

Sub-Goals / Means
-----------------

- ***Simplifying*** musical score, for easier reading.
- Discovering ***structures*** in the music, for memorization.
- Working out / learning the ***chords*** of classical piano pieces.
- Developing ***harmonic insight*** into chords and such.
    - For better memorization.
    - To improvise myself out of a mistake.
    - To improvise for entertainment purposes.
- Studying ***motions*** of the ***body*** in detail, to help with technique.
- Studying ***'color palette'*** of piano sound, to increase abilities for expression.
- Studying ***arpeggios*** and ***scales*** and such to practice some basic motions.
- ***Respecting*** any note / chord / sound / way of playing as "welcome".
- ***Sharing*** most of the things I produce, including chords and simplified sheet music and other analyses, and possibly records in the future too.
- ***Recording*** my playing:
    - For reflection purposes.
    - To put online perhaps.
    - For entertainment purposes, hopefully.

Background
----------

I have had this piano playing hobby for many years since youth. I had music lessons for quite some years. This hobby has been on a break from time to time.

I am giving this piano playing hobby a spin again, to have something nice to do.  

I have autism and health-problems both physical and mentally. That may limit what I might be able to achieve.

Because I have autism, the way things work for me might be quite different. I might adapt the way I approach things to what works best for me.

The music hobby may be a way to train capabilities that have diminished from a therapeutic point of view.
