Studying Notes
--------------

Tried playing along by ear with a YouTube video. Went OK. Piece seems more easy than I thought. But even an easier piece might be challenging, because:

### Memorization

I might have problems memorizing though. How many times a melody repeats. What part follows what. When it is over. Perhaps a ***phrase / repetition*** structure analysis might work.

### Rhythm

Also I tend to forget the rhythm / pulse, which I guess may be considered the harder part about this. If I flunk it, people may frown. But also: I said to myself: I am not going to be hard on myself. So I do not think I am going to be so hard on myself regarding this.

### Chords / Improvising

I told myself to do something with chords and improvising. I might make versions of sheet music with chords on it. Perhaps one with melody and chords. Perhaps one with harmonic analysis, if I may take the improvisation a bit further with it.

### Sheet Music Simplification

- [x] Scanning score.  
- [x] Brightness / contrast of the scan.
- [x] Crop image.
- [x] Removing page headers and footers.
- [x] Removing the big accolades at the left.
- [x] ~~Removing measure numbers.~~ > Were none.
- [x] ~~Removing fingering numbers.~~ > Were none.
- [x] Removing repeated key signatures.
- [x] ~~Removing 'announcing' key signatures at ends of lines.~~ > Were none.
- [x] Removing expression symbols (and pedal symbols, tempo, words, dynamics).
- [ ] __Removing expression bows.__
- [ ] Removing extension bows (and the repeated note).
- [ ] Removing some rest symbols.
- [x] Removing repeated clefs.
- [x] ~~Removing 'announcing' clef change.~~ > Were none.
- [ ] Adding measure bars if there are none.
- [ ] Simplifying note durations / voicing notation.
- [ ] Adding accidentals (even when part of key) (might take a few hours more).
- [ ] Changing B# => C , Cb => B , E# => F , Fb => E.
- [ ] Adding title (adding the word 'simplified').
- [ ] Adding page numbers (font not too small).
- [ ] Notes small? Try rearranging measures.
- [x] ~~Checking clef change integrity.~~ > Were none.
- [ ] Checking copy-paste errors.
- [ ] Checking by playing the print.
- [ ] Correcting it.
- [ ] Keep checking by playing the print, until no more corrections.
