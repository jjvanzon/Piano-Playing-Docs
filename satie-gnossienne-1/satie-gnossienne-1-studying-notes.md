Studying Notes
--------------

Tried playing along by ear with a YouTube video. Went OK. Piece seems more easy than I thought.

But even an easier piece might be challenging, because:

### Memorization

I might have problems memorizing though. How many times a melody repeats. What part follows what. When it is over. Perhaps a ***phrase / repetition*** structure analysis might work.

### Rhythm

Also I tend to forget the rhythm / pulse, which I guess may be considered the harder part about this. If I flunk it, people may frown. But also: I said to myself: I am not going to be hard on myself. So I do not think I am going to be so hard on myself regarding this.

### Chords / Improvising

I told myself to do something with chords and improvising. I might make versions of sheet music with chords on it. Perhaps one with melody and chords. Perhaps one with harmonic analysis, if I may take the improvisation a bit further with it.
