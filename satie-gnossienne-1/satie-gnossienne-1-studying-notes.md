Studying Notes
--------------

### Chords / Improvising

I told myself to do something with chords and improvising. I might make versions of sheet music with chords on it. Perhaps one with melody and chords. Perhaps one with harmonic analysis, if I may take the improvisation a bit further with it.

### Sheet Music Simplification

- [x] Scanning score.  
- [x] Brightness / contrast of the scan.
- [x] Crop image.
- [x] Removing page headers and footers.
- [x] Removing the big accolades at the left.
- [x] ~~Removing measure numbers.~~ > Were none.
- [x] ~~Removing fingering numbers.~~ > Were none.
- [x] Removing repeated key signatures.
- [x] ~~Removing 'announcing' key signatures at ends of lines.~~ > Were none.
- [x] Removing repeated clefs.
- [x] ~~Removing 'announcing' clef change.~~ > Were none.
- [x] ~~Checking clef change integrity.~~ > Were none.
- [x] Removing expression symbols (and pedal symbols, tempo, words, dynamics).
- [x] Removing expression bows.
- [x] Adding measure bars if there are none.
- [x] Adding title (adding the word 'simplified').
- [x] ~~Adding page numbers (font not too small).~~ > Only 1 page.
- [x] ~~~Notes small? Try rearranging measures.~~
- [x] Simplifying note durations / voicing notation.
- [x] Removing extension bows (and the repeated note).
- [x] Removing some rest symbols.
- [x] ~~Changing B# => C , Cb => B , E# => F , Fb => E.~~ > Were none.
- [x] Adding accidentals (even when part of key) (might take a few hours more).
- [x] Correcting spacing
- [x] Checking copy-paste errors.
- [x] Checking by playing the print.
- [x] Correcting it.
- [x] Keep checking by playing the print, until no more corrections.
