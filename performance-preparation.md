Preparation for Performance on March 4 2022
-------------------------------------------

### Pieces

- [Mozart Sonata Facile KV 545 Part 1](mozart-sonata-facile-part-1-practice-schema.md)
- [Satie Gnossienne Ⅰ](satie-gnossienne-1)

### Harder Parts

- Mozarts composition style is steady paced. But steady playing is difficult for me. I like wavy, floating-around play.
- Desire for technique and expression seem to work against each other. Hoping to strike a balance by recording and self-reviewing.

### Actions

- Recording and self-reviewing
- Hearing speakers, from audience point of view
- Installing monitor speakers

### Piece Details

- Mozart Sonata Facile KV 545 Part 1:
    - Slow practice (to feel what the hand needs)
- Satie Gnossienne Ⅰ
    - Learned by ear mostly.
    - Making alternative sheet music perhaps.
    - To aid with (lack of) memorization.
