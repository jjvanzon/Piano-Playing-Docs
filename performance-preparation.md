Preparation for Performance on March 4, 2022
--------------------------------------------

### Pieces

- [Mozart Sonata Facile KV 545 Part 1](mozart-sonata-facile-part-1)
- [Satie Gnossienne Ⅰ](satie-gnossienne-1)

### Actions

- [x] Hearing speakers, from audience point of view
- [x] ~~Installing monitor speakers~~ > Delivery delayed
- [ ] ... Recording and self-reviewing

### Harder Parts

- [x] Mozarts composition style is steady paced. But steady playing is difficult for me. I like wavy, floating-around play.
- [x] Desire for technique and expression seem to work against each other. Hoping to strike a balance by recording and self-reviewing.

### Piece Details

- [ ] Mozart Sonata Facile KV 545 Part 1:
    - [ ] Slow practice (to feel what the hand needs)
- [ ] Satie Gnossienne Ⅰ
    - [x] Learned by ear mostly.
    - [x] To aid with (lack of) memorization:
    - [ ] ... Making alternative sheet music perhaps.
